* Early Morning plans with Christine

1. Update what was last set

2. Atempt to match ideal curve for routes

# Idealistic curve changes infrequently
# Major discussion point is route density

3. Should know all routes that need to be set by the time she's done

* Morning overview with Travis

1. Volumes go up first and are not assoc with the route.

2. Route setters pick from a list of Routes that need to be set.

3. Routes can varry difficulty when being set.

4. Route sheet is updated with status as route progresses.
